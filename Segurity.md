# ClawFi Security Model

## Overview

ClawFi is designed with security as a primary concern. This document outlines the threat model, security measures, and best practices.

## Threat Model

### Assets to Protect

1. **Exchange API Keys**: Allow trading on connected exchanges
2. **Wallet Information**: Addresses and activity being monitored
3. **Trading Strategies**: Proprietary detection logic
4. **User Credentials**: Dashboard authentication
5. **Signal History**: May reveal trading patterns

### Threat Actors

1. **External Attackers**: Network-based attacks
2. **Malicious Extensions/Apps**: Running on same system
3. **Supply Chain**: Compromised dependencies
4. **Physical Access**: Device theft or unauthorized access

### Attack Vectors

1. API key theft via memory dump or log exposure
2. Man-in-the-middle on API communications
3. Database compromise
4. Session hijacking
5. Social engineering

## Security Measures

### Secret Management

**Encryption at Rest**
- All API keys and secrets encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Per-secret key derivation using HKDF
- Master key stored in environment variable (never in code/DB)

```
Master Key (env) → HKDF → Per-Secret Key → AES-256-GCM → Encrypted Data
```

**Key Rotation**
- Support for re-encrypting secrets with new context
- Version field for future encryption upgrades

**Never Logged**
- Secrets are redacted in all log output
- Audit logs contain only sanitized data

### API Key Restrictions

**CRITICAL: Binance API Keys**

When creating API keys for ClawFi:

1. ✅ Enable: Spot Trading (if auto-trading desired)
2. ✅ Enable: Read-Only for account info
3. ❌ **DISABLE: Withdrawals** - ClawFi NEVER needs this
4. ❌ **DISABLE: Futures Trading** (unless explicitly needed)
5. ✅ Set IP whitelist to your node's IP

ClawFi does NOT implement withdrawal endpoints by design.

### Authentication

**User Auth**
- Passwords hashed with Argon2id
- JWT tokens with configurable expiry
- Secure token storage (HTTP-only cookies in browser)

**API Auth**
- Bearer token authentication
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Input validation with Zod

### Network Security

**Recommended Setup**
- Run node behind reverse proxy (nginx/caddy)
- Enable HTTPS/TLS
- Firewall all ports except necessary
- Use VPN for remote access

**CORS**
- Strict origin checking in production
- Credentials require explicit allowlist

### Risk Engine Guardrails

Even if an attacker gains API access, they're limited by:

1. **Max Order Size**: Hard limit on USD per trade
2. **Max Position**: Limit on total exposure
3. **Max Daily Loss**: Trading stops at threshold
4. **Max Slippage**: Prevents manipulation attacks
5. **Token Allowlist/Denylist**: Restrict tradeable assets
6. **Cooldown Period**: Rate limit on trades
7. **Dry-Run Mode**: Default to simulation
8. **Kill Switch**: Emergency stop all trading

### Audit Trail

All actions are logged:
- User authentication events
- Connector operations
- Trading requests (approved/rejected)
- Risk policy changes
- Strategy state changes

Logs include:
- Timestamp
- User ID (if applicable)
- Action type
- Success/failure
- Sanitized details (no secrets)

## Best Practices

### For Operators

1. **Generate strong master key**
   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 32
   ```

2. **Use environment files for secrets**
   - Never commit `.env` to git
   - Use file permissions (600)

3. **Enable testnet first**
   - Verify all functionality before mainnet

4. **Regular backups**
   - Database backups (encrypted)
   - Keep master key backup secure and offline

5. **Monitor audit logs**
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity

6. **Update dependencies**
   - Regular security updates
   - Monitor for CVEs in dependencies

### For Development

1. **Never log secrets**
   - Use `redactSensitive()` helper
   - Review logs before commits

2. **Validate all input**
   - Use Zod schemas
   - Sanitize database queries

3. **Principle of least privilege**
   - Connectors only get needed permissions
   - Strategies can't access raw credentials

4. **Secure defaults**
   - Dry-run mode enabled by default
   - Conservative risk limits

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Enable Kill Switch** immediately
2. **Revoke API keys** on exchanges
3. **Review audit logs** for unauthorized actions
4. **Rotate master key** if database compromised
5. **Report issues** to security@clawfi.example

## Known Limitations

1. **Single-user mode**: Current auth is basic; not suitable for multi-tenant
2. **Local execution**: Wallet signing requires user confirmation
3. **No HSM support**: Master key in environment variable
4. **Browser extension**: Inherits browser security model

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Strong master key generated and backed up
